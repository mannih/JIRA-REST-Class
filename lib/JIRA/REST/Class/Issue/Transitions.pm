# ABSTRACT: A helper class for L<JIRA::REST::Class|JIRA::REST::Class> that represents the state transitions a JIRA issue can go through.  Currently assumes a state diagram consisting of Open/In Progress/Resolved/Reopened/In QA/Verified/Closed.

=method B<transitions>

Returns an array of
L<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue::Transitions::Transition|JIRA::REST::Class::Issue::Transitions::Transition>
objects representing the transitions the issue can currently go through.

=accessor B<issue>

The L<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue|JIRA::REST::Class::Issue> object this is a
transition for.

Blocks the issue.

=method B<close>

Closes the issue.

=cut

=method B<verify>

Verifies the issue.

Resolves the issue.

Reopens the issue.

Starts progress on the issue.

Stops progress on the issue.

=method B<start_qa>

Starts QA on the issue.

=cut

=method B<transition_walk>

This method takes three unnamed parameters:
  + The name of the end target issue status
  + A hashref mapping possible current states to intermediate states
    that will progress the issue towards the end target issue status
  + A callback subroutine reference that will be called after each
    transition with the name of the current issue state and the name
    of the state it is transitioning to (defaults to an empty subroutine
    reference).

=head2 JIRA REST API Reference L<Do transition|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#api/2/issue-doTransition>

The fields that can be set on transition, in either the fields parameter or the
update parameter can be determined using the
C</rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/transitions?expand=transitions.fields>
resource. If a field is not configured to appear on the transition screen, then
it will not be in the transition metadata, and a field validation error will
occur if it is submitted.
