# ABSTRACT: A helper class for L<JIRA::REST::Class|JIRA::REST::Class> that represents a JIRA query as an object.  Allows the user to iterate over the results and retrieve them one by one.  Wraps L<JIRA::REST|JIRA::REST>'s L<set_search_iterator|JIRA::REST/"set_search_iterator PARAMS"> and L<next_issue|JIRA::REST/next_issue> methods to make them a bit more object-like.

=method B<issue_count>

A count of the number of issues matched by the query.

=cut

sub issue_count { return shift->total }

=method B<next>

The next issue returned by the query, as a
L<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue|JIRA::REST::Class::Issue> object.  If there are
no more issues matched by the query, this method returns an undefined value.

If the L</restart_if_lt_total> method is set to true and the number of
issues fetched is less than the total number of issues matched by the query
(see the L</issue_count> method), this method will rerun the query and keep
returning issues. This is particularly useful if you are transforming a
number of issues through an iterator, and the transformation causes the
issues to no longer match the query.

        return $self->factory->make_object( 'issue', { data => $issue } );

=internal_method B<_get_next_unseen_issue>

Method to consolidate code that fetches issues without duplication

=cut

sub _get_next_unseen_issue {
    my $self  = shift;
    my $issue = $self->JIRA_REST->next_issue;

    # loop if we got an issue but we've seen it already

        $issue = $self->JIRA_REST->next_issue;
    }

    return $issue;
}

=method B<restart_if_lt_total>

This getter/setter method tells the iterator whether to restart the search
if the number of issues found is less than the issue count returned by the
initial search.

=cut

=internal_method B<set_search_iterator>

Method that is used to restart a query that has run out of results prematurely.

=cut

    my $self = shift;
    my $args = shift || $self->iterator_args;

    $self->JIRA_REST->set_search_iterator( $args );

    # search, let's track how many we get so we can re-search if necessary
