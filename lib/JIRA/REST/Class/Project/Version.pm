# ABSTRACT: A helper class for L<JIRA::REST::Class|JIRA::REST::Class> that represents a version of a JIRA project as an object.

Readonly my @ACCESSORS => qw( archived id name projectId released self );

__PACKAGE__->mk_data_ro_accessors( @ACCESSORS );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object represents a version of JIRA project as an object.  It is
overloaded so it returns the C<name> of the project version when
stringified, the C<id> of the project version when it is used in a numeric
context, and the value of the C<released> field if is used in a boolean
context.  If two of these objects are compared I<as strings>, the C<name> of
the project versions will be used for the comparison, while numeric
comparison will compare the C<id>s of the project versions.
